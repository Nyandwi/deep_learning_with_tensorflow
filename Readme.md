This is a comprehensive repository containing end to end notebooks for basic neural network tasks, computer vision and Natural Language Processing(NLP). 


All notebooks were created with the readers in mind. Every notebook starts with a high-level overview of any specific algorithm/concepts being covered. Wherever possible, visuals are used to make things clear. 


## Viewing and Running the Notebooks

The easiest way to view all the notebooks is to use Nbviewer.

If you want to play with the codes, you can use the following platforms: 

* <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/Nyandwi/deep_learning_tensorflow" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

* <a href="https://deepnote.com/project/deep_learning_tensorflow"><img src="https://deepnote.com/buttons/launch-in-deepnote-small.svg" alt="Launch in Deepnote" /></a>

*Deepnote will direct you to `Intro to Artificial Neural Networks`. Heads to the project side bar for more notebooks.*


## Tools Overview

## Tool Overview


TensorFlow is a popular deep learning framework used for building models suitable for different fields such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. 

At its backend, it uses Keras which is a high level API for building neural networks easily. TensorFlow has gained a lot of popularity in the ML community due to its complete ecosystem made of wholesome tools including TensorBoard, TF Datasets, TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow Extended, TensorFlow.js, etc...
